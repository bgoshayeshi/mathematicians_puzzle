# Two Mathematicians Puzzle Solution

This repository contains the Python code used to solve the "Two Mathematicians Puzzle", a fun and interesting mathematical challenge. It leverages basic mathematical concepts and some Python libraries to solve the puzzle.

## Problem Statement

Two mathematicians, A and B, each know different things about two mystery numbers, x and y.

- Mathematician A knows the sum of these numbers (x+y).
- Mathematician B knows the product of these numbers (x*y).

Through a series of exchanges, A and B manage to deduce the values of x and y. The challenge is to find these numbers using the information provided in the conversation.

## How It Works

This solution uses Python to filter out possible combinations of x and y based on the clues given in the conversation. The Python script performs some logical checks and outputs the solution to the puzzle.
